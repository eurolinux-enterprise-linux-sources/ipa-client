Installation example:

TEMPORARY: until bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=248169 is
           fixed.

Please apply the fedora-ds.init.patch in freeipa/ipa-server/ipa-install/share/
to patch your init scripts before running ipa-server-install. This tells
FDS where to find its kerberos keytab.

Things done as root are denoted by #. Things done as a unix user are denoted
by %.

# cd freeipa
# patch -p0 < ipa-server/ipa-install/share/fedora-ds.init.patch

Now to do the installation.

# cd freeipa
# make install

To start an interactive installation use:
# /usr/sbin/ipa-server-install 

For more verbose output add the -d flag run the command with -h to see all options

You have a basic working system with one super administrator (named admin).

To create another administrative user:

% kinit admin@FREEIPA.ORG
% /usr/sbin/ipa-adduser -f Test -l User test
% ldappasswd -Y GSSAPI -h localhost -s password uid=test,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=freeipa,dc=org
% /usr/sbin/ipa-groupmod -a test admins

An admin user is just a regular user in the group admin.

Now you can destroy the old ticket and log in as test:

% kdestroy
% kinit test@FREEIPA.ORG
% /usr/sbin/ipa-finduser test
