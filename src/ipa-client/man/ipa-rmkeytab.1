.SH "NAME"
ipa\-rmkeytab \- Remove a kerberos principal from a keytab
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-rmkeytab [ \fB\-p\fR principal\-name ] [ \fB\-k\fR keytab\-file ] [ \fB\-r\fR realm ] [ \fB\-d\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Removes a kerberos principal from a \fIkeytab\fR.

Kerberos keytabs are used for services (like sshd) to
perform kerberos authentication. A keytab is a file
with one or more secrets (or keys) for a kerberos
principal.

A kerberos service principal is a kerberos identity
that can be used for authentication. Service principals
contain the name of the service, the hostname of the
server, and the realm name.

ipa\-rmkeytab provides two ways to remove principals.
A specific principal can be removed or all principals for all
principals for a given realm can be removed.

All encryption types and versions of a principal are removed.

The realm may be included when removing a specific principal but
it is not required.

\fBNOTE:\fR removing a principal from the keytab does not affect
the Kerberos principal stored in the IPA server. It merely removes
the entry from the local keytab.
.SH "OPTIONS"

   # ipa\-rmkeytab \-p ldap/foo.example.com \-k /etc/krb5.keytab

  # ipa\-rmkeytab \-r EXAMPLE.COM \-k /etc/krb5.keytab
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
